# Project Description
This project aims to develop a relational database management system for a personality test website, centered on the domain of psychology. The main feature of this website is to offer users the ability to discover their [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) personality through a concise test. The MBTI is a widely recognized psychological tool that categorizes personality types based on four dichotomies: Introversion vs. Extraversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judging vs. Perceiving.

Upon completion of the test, the system will analyze the responses to ascertain the user's MBTI type, such as INTJ, ENFP, ISTJ, etc. The database will store detailed profiles for each of the 16 possible MBTI personality types, including their characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for personal growth.

The website will then present customized content and recommendations tailored to the user's specific personality type. This could include advice on career paths, relationship guidance, personal development strategies in the form of books, videos, and articles.
